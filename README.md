Your Health Assistant for Assam: Immediate Guidance When You Need It Most

In today’s fast-paced world, getting quick and reliable health information is more important than ever. Especially on a quiet Sunday evening or during late hours, finding answers to urgent health questions can be a challenge. To address this need, we have developed a helpful chatbot on Telegram, designed to be your personal health assistant, available 24/7 right on your phone.

This service is created with the people of Assam in mind, aiming to provide clear, accessible medical information to every corner of the community. Our bot is simple to use and works well even with a slow internet connection, ensuring that help is always just a message away. It is built to break down language barriers by communicating fluently in both English and Assamese (অসমীয়া), making it comfortable and easy for everyone to use.

The bot offers three main services to support your health needs. First, it provides verified first-aid guidance for common situations like minor burns, cuts, or fevers. These are simple, step-by-step instructions that can help you manage the situation until you can see a doctor.

Second, in an emergency or when you are in an unfamiliar place, the bot can help you find nearby hospitals. By simply sharing your location, you will receive a list of the closest government hospitals and clinics, complete with map links to guide you there.

Finally, the bot makes it easy to schedule a tele-consultation. You can book a free or low-cost appointment to speak with a healthcare provider over the phone, saving you time and travel. The bot will guide you through the simple booking process.

Our goal is to empower you with the information you need to make calm and informed health decisions.
